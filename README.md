# SPMB-WebTracker
Program to track a student's name in Sistem Penerimaan Murid Baru Kepulauan Riau website, and apply an algorithm to sort students by their scores respectively. The program also able to handle overflow case, aka distribution logic for students that ranked below the available seats. Note: FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.
Note #2: Since the data from the source website has been removed, the program therefore can't work. It might still probably work later in the next SPMB season with a little it of tweaks on the source code.
